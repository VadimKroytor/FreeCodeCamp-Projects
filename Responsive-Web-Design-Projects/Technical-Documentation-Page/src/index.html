                <p>The IBM® implementation of the Java™ platform provides development tools and an application
                    runtime
                    environment.
                    <br><br>
                    The Java programming language is a high-level, object-oriented language. When written,
                    a Java program is compiled into bytecode. The bytecode is interpreted at run time by a
                    platform-specific Java component. This component acts
                    as a translator between the language and the underlying operating system and hardware. This
                    staged
                    approach to compiling and interpreting Java applications means that application code can be
                    easily
                    ported across hardware platforms and
                    operating systems.

                    <br><br>
                    The IBM implementation of the Java platform is based upon the Java Technology
                    developed by Oracle Corporation. IBM supply an installable package, the Software Developers Kit
                    (SDK).

                    IBM® SDK, Java™ Technology Edition, Version 8 is a new release that is fully compatible with Oracle
                    Java SE version 8 class libraries.

                    The IBM implementation of Java contains IBM technology and extensions.
                    <br><br>
                    Monthly refreshes of the SDK for certain platforms are made available on the Java SDK support pages.
                    These refreshes can contain new features and serviceability improvements, plus fixes from Oracle and
                    IBM. Only levels that contain significant changes are documented in this user guide.

                <p>
                    The SDK contains development tools and a Java™ runtime environment. The SDK is an installable Java
                    package, which contains the Java Application Programming Interface (API). The Java API is a large
                    collection of ready-made classes, grouped into libraries,
                    that help you develop and deploy applications. The SDK also includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Java compiler.</li>
                    <li>A Java Virtual Machine (JVM or VM).</li>
                    <li>Tools for monitoring, debugging, and documenting applications.</li>
                    <li>Tools for developing user interfaces, or GUIs.</li>
                    <li>Integration libraries for applications that must access databases and remote objects.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h1> Installing the SDK</h1>
                </header>

                <p>
                    On AIX® systems, you can install the SDK from an InstallAnywhere package, or from an installp
                    package.
                    If you are using one of the supported non-UTF8 CJK locales, you must install one of the following
                    file sets:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>X11.fnt.ucs.ttf (for ja_JP or Ja_JP)</li>
                    <li>X11.fnt.ucs.ttf_CN (for zh_CN or Zh_CN)</li>
                    <li>X11.fnt.ucs.ttf_KR (for ko_KR)</li>
                    <li>X11.fnt.ucs.ttf_TW (for zh_TW or Zh_TW)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p> When using the zh_TW.IBM-eucTW locale on 64-bit AIX 6.1, you might get a result that uses ISO-8859-1
                    instead of IBM-eucTW, in response to the following command:</p>

                <code>LANG=zh_TW locale charmap</code>
                <br>
                <h3> Linux </h3>

                <p>You install the SDK from an InstallAnywhere package. The InstallAnywhere packages for Linux® are
                    either archive packages or installable packages. Use the archive packages when you want to install
                    the product without any configuration. Use the installable packages when you want to install the
                    product with associated configuration, such as the setting of environment variables. </p>
                <br>
                <h3> Windows</h3>
                <p>The SDK is available only as part of an IBM product. For more information about obtaining, installing
                    and performing initial configuration of IBM® SDK, Java™ Technology Edition in such a product on
                    Windows, please contact your IBM support representative. You can, however, configure the SDK by
                    using environment variables, command-line options, and properties files. </p>
                <br>
                <h3> Verifying the Installation (AIX only)</h3>
                <p>
                    When you complete your SDK installation on an AIX® system by using an installp package, you can
                    verify that the installation was successful by removing any environment settings and running the
                    <strong>java -version </strong>command. To ensure that the verification process behaves
                    consistently, enter the following commands:
                </p>
                <code>unset LIBPATH
                    <br>
                    unset CLASSPATH
                    <br>
                    unset JAVA_COMPILER
                    <br>
                    export PATH=install_dir/jre/bin:install_dir/bin:$PATH</code>
                <br>
                <p>After running the <strong>java -version</strong> command, you should see the following output on AIX
                    from service
                    refresh 5 fix pack 5 (where dates, times and specific build numbers might be different):</p>

                    The SDK contains many tools and libraries required for Java™ software development. See IBM Software
                    Developers Kit (SDK) for details of the tools available.
                    <br><br>
                    To debug Java programs, you can use the Java Debugger (JDB) application or other debuggers that
                    communicate by using the Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) that is provided by the SDK for
                    the operating system.

                    <h1>Running Java Apps</h1>
                </header>
                <p>Java™ applications can be started using the java launcher or through JNI. Settings are passed to a
                    Java application using command-line arguments, environment variables, and properties files.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Usage of Java Virtual Machine</h3>
                <p>The JVM searches for the initial class (and other classes that are used) in three sets of locations:
                    the bootstrap class path, the installed extensions, and the user class path. The arguments that you
                    specify after the class name or .jar file name are passed to the main function.
                    The java and javaw commands have the following syntax: </p>
                <code>java [options] &ltclass&gt [arguments]
                    <br>
                    java [options] -jar &ltfile.jar&gt [arguments]
                    <br>
                    javaw [options] &ltclass&gt [arguments]
                    <br>
                    javaw [options] -jar &ltfile.jar&gt [arguments]</code>
                <br>

                <h3>Obtaining Version information</h3>
                <p>
                    You obtain the IBM® build and version number for your Java™ installation by using the -version or
                    -fullversion options. You can also obtain version information for all jar files on the class path by
                    using the -Xjarversion option. To see the current java version being used on your machine, input the
                    following into your OS command line terminal:
                </p>
                <code>java -version</code>
                <br>
                <p>To obtain only the build information for the runtime environment, type the following command:</p>
                <code>java -fullversion</code>
