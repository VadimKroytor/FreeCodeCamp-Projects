  <p class="bold"> Here's a time line of Kent Beck's major accomplishments:</p>

  <div id="tribute-info">
    <ul>
      <li> <span class="bold"> 1997</span>: Kent Beck introduces user stories at the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit.
      </li>
      <li> <span class="bold"> 1998</span>: Alistair Cockburn visited the C3 project and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation." 
      </li>

      <li> <span class="bold"> 1999</span>: Kent Beck published the first edition of the book Extreme Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming (XP), and the usage of user stories in the planning game.
      </li>

      <li> <span class="bold"> 2001</span>: Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:  
        <ul>
          <li> The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to hold the concepts;
          </li>
          <li>           The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;
          </li>
          <li> The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> <span class="bold">2001</span>: The XP team at Connextra in London devised the user story format and shared examples with others.
      </li>
      <li> <span class="bold">2004</span>: Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development that is now considered the standard reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories. While Davies was a team member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with the invention.
      </li>
      <li> <span class="bold">2014</span>: After a first article in 2005 and a blog post in 2008, in 2014 Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give better visibility to their interdependence.
